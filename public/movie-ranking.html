<h1>The Best Movies According To Fidelis</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>This is a classic by legendary filmmaker, Quentin Tarantino
    By genre, it is the best Dark comedy film I have had the privilege of watching
    Definitely recommend 10/10
</p>
<h3>The Goodfellas</h3>
<p>Martin Scorsese really did a madness on this one. One of the greatest gangster films ever made, 
    it is a great movie to put on during a movie night, and is sure to leave your 
    guests on the edge of their seats
</p>
<h3>The Departed</h3>
<p>Another Martin Scorsese classic, this is a really thrilling watch, and is easily one of the most exciting movies I have ever seen</p>
