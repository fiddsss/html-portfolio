<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a budding web developer, learning under the tutelage of the great Angela Yu. I have a degree in Computer science
  although this is supplementary knowledge to boost the theoretical aspect of what I have learned in the past. You will find that I am capable of doing any work you might need me for
</p>

<p>This is just the beginning but I hope to be something of an expert with the pace I'm moving at, by the time I'm done with all this</p>

<p>I will detail everything I am doing to show the nature of my progress from beginner to expert. Join me on my journey to becoming a competent Web developer</p>
